# MonoGame Spaceshooter
The SpaceShooter was a short game I made during my first year at university, I made a demonstration video which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDEEs2XJdoI). The purpose of the project was to showoff my C# knowledge and show that I could develop all the nessecary components for a game from the ground up, the brilliant MonoGame engine provided the basis for user input, graphics and content control.

However the rest of the game was all of my own design, the data structures and systems nessecary for the game I made from scratch. The 2D physics, collision detection, gameplay, a component based gameobject system, drawing entities, player input, raycasting, and all the remaining parts of the project.

The game itself was just the surface of the project (around 15% of the code I wrote), almost all of my time on this project went into the 2D engine.
