# Energy Simulation
I developed the Energy Simulation demo to show-off my ability to prototype existing game systems and implement them in a fast and efficent matter so that they can be tested and iterated upon quickly.

The Energy Simulation uses a Watts/Joules system to produce, store, and consume energy. A 2D interface with basic controls allows the user to adjust and create electrical circuits as they desire to test out multiple situations.

The source code for the Energy Simulation demo is avaliable on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Liam-Harrison/EnergySim), you can download the repository and load it up within Unity.

# Screenshots & Media
