# Celeritas
Celeritas was a year long, multi-University game project, where I was the lead-programmer and developer. The game had complex requirements to achieve its goals, which included allowing the player to place and modify their ships in an infinte amount of ways, moudles added a variety of effects similar to Risk of Rain, where rooms could be added to ships which added complex effects and interactions.

The game needed to have these complex systems be implemented by our general designers, so the implementation needed to expose these complex systems in simple and effective ways for our general developers to interact with them. Designers could implement complex game-changing mechanics quickly, easily, and safely.

The source code for Celeritas is avaliable on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Liam-Harrison/Celeritas), you can download the full game under releases.
