## Who am I?
I’m a 26 year old indie game developer who loves playing and making games. I’m currently a Game Developer at Ludeon Studios developing RimWorld, I was previously a full stack web-dev and worked at a software startup.

## Education
Bachelor of [Computer Science with a major in Software Design](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/bachelor-of-computer-science/) at the Swinburne University of Technology in Victoria, Australia.

## Experience
I previously was employed at Fologram as a Software Developer, primarily I maintained and developed the Unity project of Folograms proprietary software. My role included all aspects of development such as leading the development of the Oculus Quest platform, extending and updating the CAD integration plugins, writing unit tests and creating original enterprise level code.

Additonally I was also the lead programmer on a year long University capstone project called Celeritas, where we collaberated with other Universitys to create a complete game which was shown off at PAX Australia.

# My Projects:
These are all my personal projects, for these projects I have created webpages for each individual one - each going into allot more detail about the project and showing videos and screenshots.

### [Celeritas](./celritas.html)
This was a year long project I worked on at University, I was the lead-programmer responsible for a game which had very complex requirements and was very data orientated.

### [QuestLike](./zorkish.html)
This game was based on Zork & Dwarf Fortress, built in C# and with very deep and tightly coupled game systems. QuestLike is a demonstration of ability to write deep & intelligent gamesystems, combining well designed data structures and systems to allow the player to do just about anything.

### [Energy Simulation](./energy.html)
This is a small 2D, interactable recreation of a common energy simulation system used in popular sandbox games such as Oxygen Not Included.

### [Battle RPG Demo](./iso-rpg.html)
The Battle RPG was a small game I made to showcase my AI, Navigation mesh and system design skills.

# Other projects I've contributed too:

### [Roark's Attack on Titan Fan Game](https://gamejolt.com/games/raot/613147)
I contributed to this project for some time - we post Youtube updates frequently which show off the latest version of the game and its graphics. I did allot of work on character controls and lead a successful total multiplayer networking rework. I have continually contributed to the project in my spare time and coordinated with contributors around the world in an agile fashion to create an extremely highly polished, fast-paced, multiplayer PvP game.

### [X-Wing Virtual Machine](https://www.moddb.com/mods/xwvm)
I contributed to the XWVM project for a short amount of time, I am still connected to the project but haven't contributed in some time. I primarily did bug-fixing to support the current developers and make the game as close to the originals as possible.
