## Who am I?
I’m a 26 year old indie game developer who loves playing and making games. I’m currently a Game Developer at Ludeon Studios developing RimWorld, I was previously a full stack web-dev and worked at a software startup. I'm currently living in Japan, but I'm from Victora, Australia.

## Education
Bachelor of [Computer Science with a major in Software Design](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/bachelor-of-computer-science/) at the Swinburne University of Technology in Victoria, Australia.

## Experience

As a Game Developer at Ludeon Studios, some of the responsibilities I do on a day to day basis include:
- Writing effective and efficent C# and HLSL.
- Designing, architecting, and implementing systems and content into a deeply complex and mature game.
- Game Design, including creating specifications, and providing feedback on in-game systems and content for iteration.
- Assisting with all steps of the hiring process, including screening candidates and onboarding.
- Performing code reviews, and collaberating with my colleagues to produce incredibly unique gaming experiences.
- Leading and participating in an entirely remote collabertive work enviroment to produce the best product possible.

I previously was employed at software startup called Fologram as a Software Developer, primarily I maintained and developed the Unity project of Folograms proprietary software. My role included all aspects of development such as leading the development of the Oculus Quest platform, Android, iOS, and Hololens 1 & 2, as well as extending and updating the CAD integration plugins, writing unit tests and creating original enterprise level code.

Additonally I also have industry experience as a full stack web-dev, working in ASP.NET and React. I was also the lead programmer on a year long University capstone project called Celeritas, where we collaberated with other Universities to create a complete game which was shown off at PAX Australia.

# Industry Credits

### [RimWorld Odyssey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3022790/RimWorld__Odyssey/)
I was involved in the entire development of Odyssey, from inital conception, to design, development, execution, and quality assurance. Here are some of the keypoints:
- Co-lead the technical development of the expansion and base-game update.
- Conceptualized, developed, conducted playtesting for all aspects of Space and Orbit in Odyssey.
- Helped consolidated and apply over a year of playtesting to the expansion in the form of minor and major adjustments and changes.
- Updated existing systems to enable new design opportunities and possiblities. Such as multithreading/optimizing pathfinding, adding a variable tickrate architecture, and rewriting the glow grid lighting system, and various changes to the codebase which significantly improved performance.
- Provided technical expertise to other programmers.

### [RimWorld Anomaly](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380740/RimWorld__Anomaly/)
I was involved in all of Anomalys development, excluding inital design and conceptualization.
- Integrated and developed game content according to specifications.
- Optimized and significantly improved performance of the base-game.
- Provided feedback for various game content, and acted on playtest information to produce the best product possible.

### [RimWorld Biotech](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1826140/RimWorld__Biotech/)
I was involved in the tailend of Biotechs development, helping with bugfixing and delivery.
- Assisted developers and designers in a supportive capacity, fixing bugs and corrdinating with playtesters to ensure QA.
- Playtesting and providing feedback just before release.

### [Fologram](https://fologram.com/)
I was the primary programmer, and lead developer for the entire Unity application which was deployed onto Meta Quest, Hololens 1 & 2, iOS, and Android.
- Designed and developed the Unity solution portion of Folograms proprietary software to visualize and sync CAD documents.
- Developed one project which was ran and could be deployed to all target platforms via build pipelines.

# Personal Projects
These are some of my personal projects, for these projects I have created webpages for each individual one - each going into allot more detail about the project and showing videos and screenshots.

### [Celeritas](./celritas.html)
This was a year long project I worked on at University, I was the lead-programmer responsible for a game which had very complex requirements and was very data orientated.

### [QuestLike](./zorkish.html)
This game was based on Zork & Dwarf Fortress, built in C# and with very deep and tightly coupled game systems. QuestLike is a demonstration of ability to write deep & intelligent gamesystems, combining well designed data structures and systems to allow the player to do just about anything.

### [Energy Simulation](./energy.html)
This is a small 2D, interactable recreation of a common energy simulation system used in popular sandbox games such as Oxygen Not Included.

### [Battle RPG Demo](./iso-rpg.html)
The Battle RPG was a small game I made to showcase my AI, Navigation mesh and system design skills.

# Other Projects

### [Roark's Attack on Titan Fan Game](https://gamejolt.com/games/raot/613147)
This project was completed some years ago, I did allot of work on character controls and lead a successful total multiplayer networking rework. I coordinated with contributors around the world in an agile fashion to create an extremely highly polished, fast-paced, multiplayer PvP game. The main challenge was producing a fun and fair enviroment in a fast paced PvP context with peer to peer networking while gracefully handling significant amounts of latency.

### [X-Wing Virtual Machine](https://www.moddb.com/mods/xwvm)
I contributed to the XWVM project for a short amount of time, I am still connected to the project but haven't contributed in some time. I primarily did bug-fixing to support the current developers and make the game as close to the originals as possible.
