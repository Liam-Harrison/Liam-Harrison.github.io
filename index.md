## Who am I?
I'm a 23 year old programmer who digs games and making games. I live in Victoria, Australia. I'm a Software and Game Developer, and previously worked at Fologram, a company who specalize in AR and VR technology in the Unity engine.

## Education
Finishing a bachelor of [Computer Science with a major in Software Design](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/bachelor-of-computer-science/) at the Swinburne University of Technology in Victoria, Australia.

Completed secondary school at [Bendigo Senior Secondary College](http://www.bssc.edu.au/) and recieved a [Victorian VCE certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education) - Where I studied biology, mathematics, english, software development and electronic engineering.

## Experience
I previously was employed at Fologram as a Software Developer, primarily I maintained and developed the Unity project of Folograms proprietary software. My role included all aspects of development such as leading the development of the Oculus Quest platform, extending and updating the CAD integration plugins, writing unit tests and creating original enterprise level code.

Additonally I was also the lead programmer on a year long University capstone project called Celeritas, where we collaberated with other Universitys to create a complete game which was shown off at PAX Australia.

# My Projects:
These are all my personal projects, for these projects I have created webpages for each individual one - each going into allot more detail about the project and showing videos and screenshots.

### [Celeritas](./celritas.html)
This was a year long project I worked on at University, I was the lead-programmer responsible for a game which had very complex requirements and was very data orientated.

### [QuestLike](./zorkish.html)
This game was based on Zork & Dwarf Fortress, built in C# and with very deep and tightly coupled game systems. QuestLike is a demonstration of ability to write deep & intelligent gamesystems, combining well designed data structures and systems to allow the player to do just about anything.

### [Battle RPG Demo](./iso-rpg.html)
The Battle RPG was a small game I made to showcase my AI, Navigation mesh and system design skills.

# Other projects I've contributed too:

### [Roark's Attack on Titan Fan Game](https://gamejolt.com/games/raot/613147)
I contributed to this project for some time - we post Youtube updates frequently which show off the latest version of the game and its graphics. I did allot of work on character controls and lead a successful total multiplayer networking rework. I have continually contributed to the project in my spare time and coordinated with contributors around the world in an agile fashion to create an extremely highly polished, fast-paced, multiplayer PvP game.

### [SpessVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/898200/Spess/)
I helped Powerworks Games develop the groundwork of Spess, a new company which was created specifically for the production of the game. I primarily did systems design, multiplayer networking and the desktop component of the game - this mainly included quickly prototyping systems for the company such as this [contextual interaction system (see 2:00 - 2:30)](https://youtu.be/1TC-ozF7dWI?t=118) and the [Level Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TC-ozF7dWI). However I only helped Powerworks Games begin development of Spess, and haven't contributed since.

### [X-Wing Virtual Machine](https://www.moddb.com/mods/xwvm)
I contributed to the XWVM project for a short amount of time, I am still connected to the project but haven't contributed in some time. I primarily did bug-fixing to support the current developers and make the game as close to the originals as possible.
